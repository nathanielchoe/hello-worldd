Hello my friends,

My name is Nathaniel H. Choe, or Nathan for short, or Nate for shorter. I am learning to code now to reconnect with my friends. It's a bit of a long tale, but I appreciate your time. With that being said, maybe I'll save the stories for another time! Ha!

Or we could share stories and talk over coffee! How about it? Coffee, code, and stories. That sounds nice. Why are you here? What brought you into the matrix? I would love to know.

Feel free to reach out.

Sincerely,
Nate
